    "For the final project, I’d like to explore the Oakland Unified School District Database. Specifically, I’ll look into the fiscal dataset, enrollment rates and demand rates. There have been news about Oakland School’s disclosure and financial crises, and debates about whether reduction in staffing and utility costs offset by student attendance, as well as cutting which kind of budget. So I think it’s interesting to learn into school’s expenditure and revenue, figuring out what’s the connection between cutting budget and student enrollment, and how does that affect parents choosing schools for their kids."
